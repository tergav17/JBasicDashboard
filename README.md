# JBasicDashboard

## What?
JBasicDashboard is exactly what it says on the tin. It is a dashboard program, that is simple, and it is written in Java. JBasicDashboard features a grid-based ridgid canvas, minimalist and lightweight graphics, and a retro aesthetic. In addition, the following elements are available to be placed on the canvas:

- Text Labels
- Title Headers
- Dividers
- Images
- Buttons
- Sliders (Horizonal and Vertical)
- Status Icons
- Text Input Boxes
- Line Graphs
- Plots
- Loggers

## Why?
The primary reason why I wrote JBasicDashboard was that I got sick of writing Java Swing applications every time I wanted to do a simple graphical project. JBasicDashboard is made to be very simple to use, and to work with virtually no configuation. It takes one line of code to get a dashboard set up, and a similar amount to add additional elements.

## Why Not?
There is no shortage of actual dashboard or graphical libraries for Java. If you are writing an actual project, there are probably dozens of other libraries that does what this does, but better. This library is good for cobbling something together in an afternoon, but anything more professional should use something else.
